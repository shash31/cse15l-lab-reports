## Part 1: Debugging Scenario

## Part 2: Reflection

Learning how to set up an SSH key for your github account was a fun and helpful experience. 
Being able to work on github projects on your local computer and then being able to update your work online from the terminal itself is very interesting and can definitely be very productive.
I also enjoyed learning about branches and pull requests on github. It helped give me a much better idea about how coding projects in groups can work on github. 
I asked questions about these in my lab and my TA helped me a lot with understanding these concepts.
